## ‚úÖ **Project Title**

**AI-Based Food Calorie Tracking System**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **1. Frontend Development**

### üîπ Purpose:

* Provides the interface where users can upload food images and view calorie estimation results.

### üîπ Technologies:

* **HTML5 & CSS3**:
  For structuring the web pages and designing the layout, including buttons, image upload fields, result displays, and responsiveness.

* **JavaScript**:
  To handle form validation, image preview before upload, and asynchronous communication (AJAX) with the backend.

* **React.js (Recommended)**:

  * Component-based structure for reusable UI elements.
  * Efficient state management (e.g., using Redux).
  * Smooth interaction (image preview, loading indicators).
  * Provides a better user experience with single-page application (SPA) behavior.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Backend Development**

### üîπ Purpose:

* Acts as the middleware between the frontend and the AI model.

### üîπ Technologies:

* **Python Flask Framework**:

  * Lightweight framework to implement REST APIs.
  * Endpoints:

    * `POST /upload`: Receives uploaded image.
    * `GET /calories/{user_id}`: Returns calorie history.
    * `POST /predict`: Returns prediction result.
  * Handles image preprocessing and invokes the AI model.
  * Returns JSON responses to the frontend with the food type and calorie estimate.

* **Flask Extensions (Optional)**:

  * Flask-RESTful: For building REST APIs in a structured way.
  * Flask-CORS: To allow frontend-backend interaction when hosted on different domains.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **3. AI / Deep Learning Model**

### üîπ Purpose:

* Classifies food from an image and estimates calories.

### üîπ Technologies & Approach:

* **Deep Learning Framework**:

  * **TensorFlow / Keras** or **PyTorch**:
    Used for model development, training, and inference.

* **Model Architecture**:

  * **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
    Efficient for image classification tasks.

  * Common models used:

    * ResNet50
    * MobileNetV2
    * EfficientNet
    * Custom CNN for lightweight solutions.

* **Transfer Learning**:

  * Pretrained on **ImageNet**.
  * Fine-tuned on food image dataset (e.g., **Food-101 Dataset**).

* **Dataset**:

  * **Food-101 Dataset**:
    Contains 101 food classes with 101,000 images.

  * Custom Dataset (optional):

    * Collect own dataset of food images with calorie labels.
    * Ensure dataset diversity to avoid bias (different lighting, angles, portion sizes).

## ‚öôÔ∏è **4. Image Preprocessing**

### üîπ Purpose:

* Prepares the uploaded image for model inference.

### üîπ Tools & Libraries:

* **OpenCV**:

  * Resizing the image to model input size (e.g., 224√ó224 pixels).
  * Normalizing pixel values to \[0,1].
  * Optional filtering (noise reduction, brightness adjustments).

* **PIL (Pillow)**:

  * Alternative to OpenCV for simple image manipulation.

* **Normalization Example**:

  ```python
  image = image / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **5. Calorie Estimation Algorithm**

### üîπ Workflow:

1. Food Type Prediction ‚Üí e.g., ‚ÄúPasta‚Äù
2. Portion Estimation (Optional):

   * Use object detection models (like YOLOv5) to estimate portion size (bounding box area).
3. Calorie Lookup Table:

   * Example mapping:

     | Food Item | Avg Calories per 100g |
     | --------- | --------------------- |
     | Pasta     | 131 kcal              |
     | Salad     | 50 kcal               |
     | Pizza     | 266 kcal              |
4. Final Calculation:

   * Calories = portion\_size\_in\_grams √ó calorie\_per\_100g √∑ 100

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **6. Database**

### üîπ Purpose:

* Store user profiles, food logs, calorie history.

### üîπ Technologies:

* **SQLite** (for small projects)
  Simple and easy-to-integrate relational DB for storing data locally.

* **PostgreSQL / MySQL** (for larger production-level apps)
  Scalable relational DB system.

* **MongoDB** (optional, NoSQL):
  For flexible schema designs (useful if food items have varying metadata).

### üîπ Data Model Example (Relational):

| Column            | Type     | Description                |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| user\_id          | INT (PK) | Unique user identifier     |
| food\_name        | TEXT     | Name of detected food      |
| calorie\_estimate | FLOAT    | Estimated calories in kcal |
| image\_path       | TEXT     | Path to the stored image   |
| timestamp         | DATETIME | Date & time of entry       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **7. API Integration**

### üîπ REST API Design:

* Standard JSON API for client-server communication.

#### Example Request:

```http
POST /predict
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
image: [binary_image_file]
```

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "food_name": "Pizza",
  "calorie_estimate": 266,
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **8. Deployment**

### üîπ Tools:

* **Docker**:

  * Containerize the whole app (frontend, backend, AI model).
  * Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production.

* **Cloud Deployment Options**:

  * **Heroku**: Easy deployment for Flask apps.
  * **AWS EC2 / Lambda**: Scalable server infrastructure.
  * **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Deploy using App Engine or Compute Engine.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **9. Optional Enhancements**

### ‚û§ User Authentication:

* JWT tokens or OAuth2 for login and secure API endpoints.

### ‚û§ Data Visualization:

* Use **Chart.js / Recharts** to display calorie consumption over time.

### ‚û§ Notifications:

* Email or in-app reminders to log meals regularly.

### ‚û§ Voice Recognition Integration:

* Speech-to-Text API to allow food input via voice commands.

## ‚úÖ **Complete System Workflow**

1. User uploads a food image from the frontend.
2. The image is sent via HTTP request to the Flask backend.
3. Backend performs image preprocessing (resize, normalize).
4. Processed image is sent to the CNN model for inference.
5. Model returns a food type prediction with confidence score.
6. Calorie is estimated using a lookup table or regression calculation.
7. Result (food name + estimated calories + confidence) is returned to the frontend.
8. The food entry is saved in the database for future tracking.
9. User views results and can see history or trends in calories.
